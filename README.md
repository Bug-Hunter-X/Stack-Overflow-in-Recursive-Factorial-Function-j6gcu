# Stack Overflow in Recursive Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: stack overflow.  The `foo` function calculates the factorial of a number. However, it doesn't handle negative input, leading to infinite recursion and a stack overflow.

The `bug.hack` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.hack` file provides a corrected version.
